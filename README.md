# Thesis
Code and datasets for my thesis titled: De novo therapeutic peptide design using deep generative models.

Chapter 6 contains:
* Code for the processing of affinity and binary PPI datasets.
* Input and output datasets. If the datasets were to heavy to upload, a README file in each section has the links to a google drive folder with them.
* Code for the generation of training, testing, validation, and benchmark datasets for the development of a PPI DL-based model.
