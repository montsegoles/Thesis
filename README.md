# Thesis
Code and datasets for my thesis: De novo therapeutic peptide design using deep generative models.

Chapter 6 contains:
* Code for the processing of affinity and binary PPI datasets.
* Input and output datasets. If the datasets were too heavy to upload to this repository, a README file in each section has links to a Google Drive folder with the remaining datasets.
* Code for the generation of training, testing, validation, and benchmark datasets for developing a PPI DL-based model.
* A text file with additional information about the structure and data of each folder.
